TODO LIST
-So this is basically the readme, I'll add sources below of the places i took code from.
From the get go i tried to work on a weak point which was the styling, unfortunately i couldnt get it to work quite a responsive as needed, so i created another style for the website.
The added bonus functions are the JSON bin, the delete and edit features.
I understood the javascript to a further extent than the css, therefore i documented various parts of the code to matchthis understanding.
A lot of hard work was put in this, hopefully it will be worth it. Thank you for the oppurtunity regardless.
