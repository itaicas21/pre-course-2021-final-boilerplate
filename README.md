TODO LIST

From the get-go I tried to work on my weak point which was the styling, but unfortunately I could'nt get it to work quite as responsive as expected, so I created another style for the website.
The added bonus functions are the JSON bin, the Delete and Edit features.
I understood the Javascript to a further extent than the CSS, therefore I documented various parts of the code to match this understanding.
A lot of hard work was put in this, hopefully it will be worth it. Thank you for the oppurtunity regardless.

StackOverflow of course for various funcitons.
Plus I've got to give credit to the guys of the group that helped me during hours no man should ever be awake.
